# introduction-to-quantum-computing_soc-25
In this course I explored the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of key quantum algorithms. As part of this learning experience, I studied and simulated protocols such as quantum teleportation and superdense coding, along with implementing standard algorithms like Grover’s search, Shor’s factoring algorithm, Quantum Fourier Transform, and Quantum Phase Estimation. I also applied knowledge of these algorithms to problem statements like decoding RSA, a widely used public-key cryptosystem AND Variational Quantum Eigensolver and Noise reduction. I developed and tested these circuits using Qiskit, gaining hands-on experience with both simulated environments and access to actual quantum hardware backends.
